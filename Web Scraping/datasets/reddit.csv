The reason I'm asking is we have had this before on oil tankers where people were crying about the shortage but than it was extremely elastic and prices dumped.

\- How short is the supply in steel, ore etc?

\- How fast can demand be met how elastic is this?

\- Why was there such a huge run up in 2003 - 2008, was this China's Boom and extreme shortage?

\- I see a lot of big manufacturers are chinese, doesn't this negatively effect price?

1. In-person dining, casinos, travel, etc are all going to absolutely skyrocket next year. People are sick of this shit and want to party HARD. If you ask your friends in 2021 to order takeout on DoorDash and have a quiet night in, you won't have friends anymore.
2. DASH is a shit app that looks like it was made in the '90's by the same people who genetically engineered N'SYNC and patented pet rocks
3. DASH drivers get paid shit and have been bitching about it a lot. If gov'ts say that these drivers have to be considered employees (which yeah duh, they are), then the DASH model makes no economic sense bc all of a sudden DASH would have to pay for luxury things like health care
4. UBER eats has significant cost advantages over DASH because they can always switch to deliver food and people at the same time. Sure the delivery might take a little longer, but you won't pay $20 for a cheeseburger
5. Anyone who isn't going out every night in the second half of 2021 is probably poor af and will be buying exclusively Ramen at Walmart

The late 90s and now represent a euphoria spike that will eventually correct and take your easy tendies away, but the fundamental value thesis has been disjointed from business reality for a while. Stonk prices were formerly STRONGLY tempered by an ability to pay out cash dividends and very simple ROI formulas that everyone could understand- a 'come to reality' accounting of their actual revenue and profit performance that couldn't be bullshitted for very long. Most equity valuations haven't been tethered to a foundational ""proof is in the pudding"" dividend reality for a long time and now transact on the much more fragile- and gameable- thesis that you own a fractional share in something that (theoretically) represents something you can (theoretically) one day sell for more to someone else because in theory, a number on a ledger went up and (theoretically) grew... and in theory, that all represents something worth buying.  We've now seen that a company can traverse an entire business lifecycle over many decades without paying a single cent in dividends and along the way, all kinds of people remain enthusiastic about its equity 'value', up the hill and back down again. 

This is not a 'new normal' or ""this time, it's different'. It has been the norm for a while, just that nobody is talking about it and what it means, shorter term, is that 'value' is whatever we say it is.  

*Accepting this persistent and long term land of make-believe that began when theoretical book valuations took the high ground over actual dividends, value fundamentals are still not dead and never will be (because at the end of the day, there's downside-risk safety in value and making tactical +ev plays is how value guys win), but value has become more of a widely influential folklore, like a religion, rather than a fundamental law of economic physics against which sale prices of shares must eventually abide by. Value is accepted or ignored at the whim of broader market liquidity, which is driven by factors that nobody here controls and probably goes back to a counsel of hooded clerics in secret rooms, somewhere in a musty Luxembourg castle. If you're playing the long-long game, OK, fine. Value... but if you're playing the short-long game, those rules don't matter. 

*If you're a value fundamentalist (which is fine, there are definitely tendies there if you're patient enough to compound tiny wins over a very long term) you can freely reject PLTR along with all other growth equities, because of what your good book says. There are no issues with you. Move along, go get that dividend, we love and support you for the son that you are to us and accept you and your husband with open arms. 

*Here's where the current, broadly-accepted narrative gets incoherent. Value is either an inarguable gravity that eventually forces everything to 'get real', or it isn't... and while value and fundamentals might be the statistically optimal on-average play on a long timeline in terms of risk, on a shorter and mid-term timeline, value is basically irrelevant compared to estimating- and getting ahead of- sentiment and estimating business trajectory. The QUALATATIVE. What we're seeing more and more of is talking heads embracing or rejecting value fundamentals situationally, if value supports a position they want to rationalize, however it doesn't work like that. 

*Example: Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley pissed on PLTR and called for underweight with a target @ 17, noting thusly:

>""With PLTR up 155% since listing with very little change in the fundamental story, the risk/reward paradigm shifts decidedly negative for the shares. Trading at ~33x CY22e sales, double the average SaaS stock at 15x, we move to an UW rating with a $17 PT.""

Looks like we've got a value-man on our hands! So lets examine the work-product of the good Mr Weiss. 

https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/keith-weiss

The same dude who appeals to 'value fundamentals' as being the reason against PLTR (the company that all the governments use to make actual magic, will continue to use indefinitely and will definitely use more and more of) maintained a buy on Splunk, a PLTR competitor (in theory), even though around the time of his writing, PLTR was trading at a DISCOUNT to SPLK. 

https://investorplace.com/2020/11/pltr-stock-investors-should-let-dust-settle-before-choosing-side/

Yes, a ""value man"".

Also, the 'fundamental story' of PLTR must take into consideration that they went public with a direct listing rather than an IPO, which completely changes the 'energy' around the initial pricing model. So, yeah... the bespoke data company that offers secrets  to governments that nobody else can duplicate, with access to data streams that nobody else has, that everyone is starting to realize they must use if they want to sin and win, that's a 'lower value' proposition than fucking DoorDash. 

Eat dongs. 

*Organized media hit pieces and narrative-campaigns for/against companies to support a financial position are standard tactics to influence price. See: Ackman and HLF.

How about 5 parts like (1)vaccine (2)merger and offer (3)bidding war (4) ALXN $160 resistance and (5) TLDR and move ideas

If you fly this not financial advice to üöÄ tendie town on the moon  üöÄ I won‚Äôt stop you from sending a pittance back to earth


*Part 1: Vaccine (the better one)*

I see all this loss porn of bets on PFE vaccine and can only ask why? That shit is way past news at this point and for the most part so is Moderna, but more importantly those two vaccines suck. Buy the rumor sell the dip, and you‚Äôve probably heard -70 degrees for storage and transport but in America thats 100 below... those sciency guys and their lab coats always talk in Celcius. Its damn hard to keep stuff this cold and that means not every clinic, truck, or plane can do it ‚Äî and if you have something that might be able to do it but shit gets too hot for the *ice queen vaccines* then suddenly you have to throw out a truckload of hard to produce doses.  Shitty


This matters specifically during a pandemic multiple ways. You can‚Äôt get that kind of low ass temp to most of the world‚Äôs population, and where you can get it you still have high transport and storage costs or risks. Add on to that the fact that buyers in a pandemic are governments buying at a low profit margin and acutely aware of these costs and risks.  PFE and MRNA can‚Äôt match future competition transport prices by cutting into vaccine profits because those are low from the start, and PFE and MRNA can‚Äôt even get vaccines to huge amounts of the worlds population without completely unreasonable loss and expense ‚Äî they‚Äôll make more money paying AZN half of the difference for AZN to ignore cities and truck to the country.

The AZN vaccine, even in cities, can probably add some profit margin and still come in cheaper per dose for governments because you can produce it easily then throw that shit in a Trader Joes frozen food delivery truck and when it gets to a clinic in the middle of nowhere the clinic‚Äôs hand-me-down fridge from Circuit City is perfectly fine. This is not great for the stock yet as AZN is distributing at cost for the start, but if we find that booster doses are needed then it will definitely matter. This isn‚Äôt even getting into the fact that the mild first-shot side effects are less likely to prevent people from coming back for their second shot which really helps governments get higher immunity at a lower price.

Now, this vaccine may not be priced in and it may even be discounted by the thing that screwed my AZN 12/31 $54.5c: AZN offered to buy ALXN at a $12B premium.


*Part 2: Merger and Offer (and 2x leverage)*

ALXN officially received an offer where each shareholder gets 2xAZN shares and $60 per share. At the time of the offer that value was $175/share, but did you catch the leverage? Thats right, AZN goes up $2 the offer goes up $4. ALXN is hovering below $160 so $4 is below in percentage to an AZN climb of $2, but calls are in dollars from the strike price not dollars from zero therefore 2x leverage. If you‚Äôre cray cray, the second ticker might also lag behind the first giving you a chance get in on a movement that already happened over at AZN and maybe even get 2x the price shift.

The timing of the merger being finalized means the movement is not 1:1 (or 1:2) right now, but it will be and consider the next part as a reason to get in sooner. Also, ALXN can‚Äôt go down hard because the lower AZN goes the lower the percentage correlation will be with a drop in ALXN, and a large drop of say 10% in a company like AZN right after the market corrected AZN is like you and sex with your wife (just not going to happen). The next part also has a reason to expect the merger not to get blocked by regulators, but first lets talk stupidity and whether that AZN correction was irrational.

Ok fellow stupid, one reason this can‚Äôt go tits up is that the offer was not done by idiots.  You and I certainly don‚Äôt know more than the board of AZN, but when debating regulatory hiccups and what a fair price was for ALXN the market hasn‚Äôt realized it knows less about drugs ‚Äî AZN tanked by as much as $8B implying that maybe the market only wanted them to offer a $4B premium instead of $12B. AZN stated they see a pretty easily attained $500M/year advantage by sharing efforts between the companies, but there‚Äôs definitely hidden benefits (like competitors not buying ALXN).  I don‚Äôt know all the synergies they see but among them would be the fact that distribution of drugs, dealing with insurance companies, sending drug pushers into clinics to convince doctors to put pamphlets in your face... it isn‚Äôt cheap, and right now both companies are probably overlapping a whole lot in these efforts even though they have basically zero overlap in products.


*Part 3: Bidding War*

This bidding war is not just likely, it is likely to get going fast. The next offer could already be on the way to ALXN because a large ALXN activist investor wrote a letter ([elliottletters.com](https://elliottletters.com/) has a copy) back in May urging the company to sell ‚Äî AZN competitors like Amgen, Gilead, Novartis, Eli Lily, PFE and others have definitely been doing their analysis and planning their offers for months, AZN was just first to the table.

The buy value bidders see in ALXN is also why regulators won‚Äôt stop it.  ALXN focuses on drugs for extremely rare diseases, putting them in a tiny but profitable niche where they don‚Äôt make anything that competes with the buyer, but they do and need things that the buyers also do an need ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing but synergy potential.  Typically buying a competitor means you might be paying for a bunch of shit that is in the target company‚Äôs stock value only to compete with you and that is a double hitter because it is a waste of your buying capital and regulators don‚Äôt like that the merger will kill off consumer choices.

So what does this mean? ALXN is going to get a huge premium in its offers because there‚Äôs no waste besides the premium, and regulators won‚Äôt stop it for the same reason. This is why ALXN price targets are up closer to or at the $200 mark now despite that being at least a 60% premium compared to last week ‚Äî everybody expects a second offer will have to come in near a $200 valuation to be competitive with the 40% premium offer.  AZNs competitors will happily hit that premium to take the $500M/year that AZN says they can get from ALXN (a hard $1B/y swing between AZN and the bidding war opponent). 

*Part 4: ALXN $160 resistance*

How do I know there‚Äôs $160 resistance? ALXN 12/18 $160c FD just barely won‚Äôt print and I wanted to know why. If it is what I saw when I looked, we‚Äôre talking dumb resistance that is definitely gonna disappear and looks to be breaking.

The higher [price targets](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ALXN/price-target/) before the merger were about $160, so a bunch of whales started selling off because their standing orders were all near or just below the old price target. Some of it was general profit-taking too, but for sure with a 30% jump already it isn‚Äôt like any of them were going to take a loss and there was a practical guarantee of an extra 10% in half a year which is a return every boomer dreams about ‚Äî these resisting boomers will realize the new $200 price target is very reasonable then stop selling below $160 and soon. They might be dumb and sell at 2x AZN + $60, but when the market sees AZN‚Äôs vaccine it will go up.

*Part 5: TLDR and move ideas*
AZN vaccine is made for global distribution unlike PFE, as long as the calls can theta longer than the market remains irrational they will see 2x the growth of AZN by using calls on ALXN, the standing offer from AZN is free insurance, and you get ALXN just before a bidding war.

poots are just premiums, long and maybe ITM calls instead. The company will likely be merged before q4 next year so ALXN 5/21 $170c or ALXN 5/21 $155c.

Aurinia pharmaceuticals is a small Canadian company with a flagship drug, voclosporin awaiting US FDA review and approval after its phase 3 trial. Voclosporin is a drug designed to treat lupus nephritis which, if untreated or poorly treated, leads to kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis and/or death. I do happen to be an internal medicine provider and can tell you the current treatment for lupus nephritis is very limited, though I am admittedly no expert on this. The potential market is a few billion dollars annually just in US market. The good news is voclosporin is in under ‚Äúurgent review‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs review schedule got pushed up due to positive phase 3 results and the target date is January 22, 2021. I did review their most recent summit presentation and the reported results are very encouraging. You may start looking around and see that volclosporin got shot down for dry eye recently, fear not. They are just searching for off label uses. They also have been testing its efficacy against covid. 

Now, that is all fine and dandy. And I‚Äôve been seeing pharm companies rocket on news like this, G L S I anyone? This kind of news triggers immediate and enormous buying, that much is irrefutable. But the pharm game is for sure a casino. In fact I just got burned putting my hand a little too close to O D T. A few pieces of news are gravitating me closer to this company though. First, AUPH leased a 17k square feet manufacturing site 20 miles from the CDC about three months ago. That would suggest they are preparing for rapid uptake in production very soon. Second, they recently bolstered an agreement with Lonza in Switzerland to also prep for huge production in the next few years. Lastly, they hired Peter Greenleaf as CEO of the company. Greenleaf is an artist at pharmaceutical company buy outs (which I see happening in 2021 possibly assuming flagship approval). All of this has me caught up in the possibilities of Christmas in January. 

TLDR:  AUPH 2/19 $17c x10, 200 shares at $14.08. Fireworks at end of January 2021. Plan: sell it all the second it rockets.

Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let‚Äôs talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¬æ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn‚Äôt speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn‚Äôt helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven‚Äôt pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let‚Äôs hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

He is the co-founder/chairman and largest shareholder in Palantir. Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.

He loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it‚Äôs nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won‚Äôt take your money. 

But by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon‚Äôs Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  

And on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.

https://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel

Look, if you don‚Äôt give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets. The only way to hold the apocalypse at bay is to invest in a few genius level people who can change the world and create millions of jobs and the best way to do that is to give all your money to Peter Thiel.

Here a DD for you about Solution 30 $S30, this is a European company specialized in solutions for new technologies. Mainly they offers a service to install new materials in companies by technicians of there company. This company has been an incredible success in 15 years, with insane growth !

Introduced on the open market in 2005 for 4.5 million ‚Ç¨. In July 2020, capitalization was in the ‚Ç¨ 1.4 billion range.
Between splits and dilutions, the stock made a good 140 baggers.

Solutions 30 recorded third-quarter revenues of 212.6 million euros, up 28.6%, and up 24% like-for-like. For the first nine months of the year, the company's sales totaled 576.3 million euros, up 19.1%, with organic growth of 12.7%

But the company has been attacked by Muddy Waters, it seems they have realised a false report of a hundred pages circulating in the square, a report that seeks to demonstrate troubled links between the company and organized crime in Italy.

Last week the company asked to suspend its quotation in order to take time to respond to these accusations. But yesterday the company asked to get back in quotation, and they have launched a counter attack :

Everyone who tuned into the earnings call last week was annoyed that GME management did not even comment on Cohen's now-infamous letter. However, listening to Ackman talking about activist investing at [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGatQk1JSas&t=420s) does shed a bit of light onto why this is. 

Ackman says that often companies will refuse to comment on activist investor requests. If the management directly comments on a proposal, then event-driven investors (like 90% of the autists here) will buy in in droves. If this happens and there is a proxy contest down the line, the activist investor will win as he/she will be backed by the event-driven investors. i.e. George Sherman didn't comment on Cohen, as he doesn't want to lose his job.

Anyone with half a brain cell probably realised from the earnings call, especially with the option for GME to issue more shares, that they are scared of a takeover. That's why we heard 'omnichannel' a trillion times, to suggest that GME are shifting to e-commerce without directly talking about Cohen's strategy.

Lastly, it has been noted here a few times that GME won't need to use the shelved shares. Gamestop is currently sitting on $500 million cash and so just don't need the extra capital. They will only exercise the right if they spot a Cohen hostile takeover, meaning it won't affect the share price greatly. 

Remember it's also Q4 earnings, not Q3, that matter.

Since then, VROOM has [acquired Carstory](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/vroom-vrm-carstory-acquisition) which I believe puts the company back on track to grow in the mid term.

Vroom fucked up when the pandemic hit by shrinking their inventory, turns out these poor autists actually demanded more cars, Vroom lost money and has been tanking since. This acquisition is a sign of confidence and a testament to their data-driven approach for the future.

The share price has double bottomed and seems to have begun a reversal.

That happened 1h before market close, why does it matter? Well most traders start closing their positions around 3pm, not opening the new ones. I believe that we will have a massive delayed reaction tomorrow, it only popping up 8% today (those who trade mid caps know that‚Äôs very minuscule run on such news). SONO cap is 2B and average trading volume is 4.5mil. Today volume was 8.5mil which isn‚Äôt too impressive (after earnings it ran 30% on 44mil vol). 

On top of that, technicals (yes I know I‚Äôll be shamed) adding up nicely, it‚Äôs above all the moving averages, on a clear upwards trend and has cleared previous resistance during daytime trading. 

I know us lot on here love short squeezes, but Sonos short position is only 5% of stocks float. In this particular situation it‚Äôs actually a good thing since after crushing earnings and now adding a subscription service they are progressing to tendie town. No shorts means very few doubters. Very few doubters mean we are going to have a lovely uptrend without much resistance. Not even mentioning that the stock is trading in less than 2x sales. Amazing bargain even after a great month. 

All four newest analyst ratings that came out on 11/19 and 10/15 are a Buy. After today‚Äôs catalyst, which is a major financial event for this company, we should hear  about more upgrades within a week or so. At least that‚Äôs what I noticed analysts like to do... 

Final point I‚Äôd like to make is that this play is not dependent on Covid news. It‚Äôs neither stay at home or reopening play. Why is that great? It is not dependent on general market whims and the run should not be spoiled by some odd Covid news.",2020-12-16 21:58:10

Typically how this works is when a stock is added to the index, another company comes out. The market cap of the new company is usually larger than the exiting one. Since the S&P 500 index is market cap weighted, the weightings of all the other stocks need to come down to make room for the new company.

**Tesla will enter the SNP as the 7th largest stock.** This has never occurred before.

This means that an absolutely massive amount of equity, $50 Billion +, has to be sold to make room for it.

The table below shows the current weighting of the largest SNP stocks and amount of equity to be sold, with the largest being $AAPL.

Climate protection cannot wait. Food giant Nestle has set itself tight targets. By 2050, the Swiss company wants to achieve ""green zero,"" meaning that its entire business should be climate-neutral. This goes along the entire supply chain. Starting with arable farming, which is being converted to soil-conserving production, and extending to the 800 Nestle sites that use green electricity. In addition, 200 million trees are planted and renaturation is promoted. In five years, all packaging should be recyclable or reusable. Nestle is investing 3.2 billion Swiss francs in this. The stock market reacted cautiously. The Swiss share price even slipped below the 100-franc mark. Investors fear that Nestle will not be able to offset the investment with efficiency gains as planned.

efficiency gains as planned. This would ultimately reduce profits. The concern seems exaggerated. The issue of sustainability is becoming increasingly important, and good money can be earned with healthy food. Nestle grows through innovations and acquisitions. Anything that is not profitable is sold, as was the case with the rice porridge business in China. The water business in North America is also up for sale. New areas such as vegan and vegetarian products and the Health Science division with products to support health are achieving double-digit growth rates. Most recently, Aimmune, a US company developing therapies for food allergies, was acquired. The deal, which is the biggest of the year so far, will certainly not be the last. The Swiss are making faster than expected progress 

faster than expected. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted sales rose 3.5 percent to 61.9 billion Swiss francs. The strong coffee business, which accounts for about a quarter of total sales, and rising online revenues more than offset declining restaurant sales. For the full year, Nestle is now confident of achieving organic growth of around three percent. The analysts at Berenberg have included Nestle in their list of top picks from the sustainability sector. They not only trust the Swiss to achieve a green zero. They also see a price potential of up to 122 francs.

We should expect more price manipulation on this stock until institutions have their hands on these remaining shares at the price they want.      Big money hates Karp for going direct listing on PLTR and depriving them of their guaranteed ten bagger by IPOing this.  The fact that retail got in on the ground floor and started bringing the price up months early, before they could secure their billion shares, has forced them into overtly manipulating the shit out of the price with admin level control.

Morgan Stanley followed up on the Citron hit piece tweet by trying to induce panic through algorithmically short bidding the stock at all hours and they will continue to do so until those restricted shares become available for them to purchase, at a price they would prefer.

This is a multi-decadal shadowy Government big data and surveillance company with the most advanced inter-agency data analytics platform currently in use at every Federal department. Sticky customers with pockets that don't end.  Try to tell me a food delivery app is worth more.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Street wanted an invite only house party and retail drunkenly found the venue before it started and invited friends.  Stop buying weekly options until the lockup, you are only supporting the heavy price suppression.  Until then PLTR is a literal casino, in that the house always wins.

Buy shares and hold, don't stop loss them.  We tipped their hand and saw the cards.  This many whales gathering in the same body of water is no coincidence.",2020-12-16 20:57:44

I know we're in a little bit of a milieu this week, between the Palantir and GameStop hype these last few weeks and the $MT steel stonk parade we're going to be seeing starting next week. I figured I'd take this time to talk about everyone's good friend Virgin Galactic

Now, I know. The stock's down a quarter after their test fiasco. But what's the long-term outlook? Is it going to the moon, and then back again in time to get the latest billionaire back for chicken tendie lunch? Or will it go tits-up and crash into the Mojave Desert? I suspect the latter. Here's why:

1. **The market is very niche.** There's 2,095 billionaires, according to [the first thing on Google](https://howmuch.net/articles/world-map-of-billionaires-2020), and 46.8 millionaires [according to ABC.](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/half-worlds-entire-wealth-hands-millionaires/story?id=66440320). So, seems like a pretty big market right?

Well, maybe. But maybe not. The initial price for a ticket was $250,000 per seat. That's a lot of money to have in cash. A lot to blow on a fun afternoon sight-seeing flight, and I really doubt most millionaires will have that to spend. So I'm going to make a really unscientific guesstimate and strike that number down by 3/4. So we're down to a market audience of about 12 million.

Next, we'll have to ask ourselves: who really wants to go to space? I do, but I don't have a quarter of a million dollars lying around. Google showed 400 people have pre-ordered tickets, but that only required a $1,000 deposit, and that's about as reliable a metric as the 14,000 people who ordered the Nikola Badger. These are early adopters, sure, but space operations need revenue and revenue requires a large market.

2. **Okay (for) Boomers?** of our millionaire and billionaire market, 99% are over 35. The average age for a millionaire is 62, and of course greater wealth skews older. The average billionaire is 65. Now, the oldest person in space was 77, so these guys should be okay right? Well, that 77 year old was Sen. John Glenn, former Marine fighter pilot and first American to orbit the Earth.  Probably better shape than most of his peers and he was just along for the ride when he went up at 77.  Nasa astronauts generally max out at about 46 years old. If you're just a tourist and you're not going to touch anything, you can definitely go older, but how much older?

Are you going to risk a 65 year-old, in average health? How about a 75 year-old? Or someone in poor health? What's the chance some old guy dies from a heart attack right as you reach the exosphere? Does VG have insurance for the oncoming lawsuit? How much does this eat into profits? If higher insurance rates jack up the price, how much does that reduce the market size?

Or say it's not safe, for at least a while, for the average >65 year old to go into space. Is VG going to cut over half their market, or are they going to pay way higher insurance premiums and suffer ensuing lower margins for these people?

3. **Perception** Branson isn't Musk.  He doesn't have the charisma, the sympathetic vision, or the memes. He's like Daniel Boone's less successful cousin Cleetus, who'd follow behind on blazed trails, getting the stumps out. People will be less excited by his successes, less forgiving of failures. And failures, with crewed aircraft,, are going to kill confidence. VG can't exactly re-enact that [SpaceX falcon crash montage](https://youtu.be/bvim4rsNHkQ) when every shot potentially results in the death of 8 people.

4. **Volatility** Imagine getting your entire call portfolio chewed up by IV. Yuck. But we're going to see a pattern with this stock: it shoots up before a test and crashes afterwards. A catastrophic failure will tank it. Can try to time shares, and just go for short-term gains, but the whole stock is at the mercy of the weather. Sure you can hold long, but as I said I don't see much of a future for this company.

5. **Disappointment in WSB** as far as I've seen, nobody's even said *$SPCE Jam* yet. Frankly I should've put this first, it's the inspiration for this whole post.

So that's my opinion, feel free to comment and tell me how I'm wrong, I'll appreciate it.
